Mobile Gym is a web application for mobile that I developed as a personal project to help me keep track of my exercises at the gym. It allows me to record all my exercises, including the name of the exercise, the weight, the sets, and an image of how to do it. All the information is stored in a database, so I can easily access my exercise history and adjust my workout routine as needed.

While Gym Exercises Tracker was originally developed for my personal use, it also serves as a showcase of my technical skills and ability to dev
elop a full-stack web application. I invite you to check out the code and give it a try for yourself.
