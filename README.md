# Mobile Gym
Mobile Gym is a web application for mobile that I developed as a personal project to help me keep track of my exercises at the gym. It allows me to record all my exercises, including the name of the exercise, the weight, the sets, and an image of how to do it. All the information is stored in a database, so I can easily access my exercise history and adjust my workout routine as needed.

## Technologies Used
* Prototype: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/m9YKk4CQGwqpaBgii8yPsT/mobile_gym?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=gBRUreQJRcXYooyt-1)<br>
* Frontend: JavaScript, Next.js, React, styled-components, Figma
* Backend: Next.js, Node.js, Prisma ORM, MySQL, AWS (for hosting the database)
## Features
- Record all your exercises, including the name, weight, sets, and an image of how to do it
- Personalize your workout routine by adjusting the weight for each exercise in real time
- Easily access the instructions for each exercise, including the image
- Store all your exercise data in a database

## Technical Skills
Developing Mobile gym allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in several key technical skills, including:

Database design and management
RESTful API development
User interface design and development
Use of version control tools (Git)

### Design
I designed the user interface for Gym Exercises Tracker myself using Figma. The design includes a clean and modern layout with easy-to-use features that allow for efficient and personalized tracking of workout progress.

### Usage
While Gym Exercises Tracker was originally developed for my personal use, it also serves as a showcase of my technical skills and ability to develop a full-stack web application. I invite you to check out the code and give it a try for yourself.
